This is the repo for my portfolio website that showcases my projects and experience.

The website is coded using React, TypeScript, SCSS and Framer Motion.

To run the app locally, install the dependencies using `npm i` and then run it using `npm start`.

The website is available online at https://radubortan.github.io.
